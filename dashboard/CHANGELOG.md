# StrydeOS Changelog

## v0.10.0 — RBAC Hardening & Onboarding (26 Mar 2026)

### Account Setup Widget (New)
- **Floating checklist** — `AccountSetupWidget.tsx` renders in top-right corner during onboarding
- **5-step progress ring** — Complete profile, Add clinic details, Connect PMS, Add clinicians, Set KPI targets
- **Auto-fills from signup** — steps already completed at registration are pre-checked
- **Dismissable** — close to collapse to pill, "Don't show this again" for permanent dismiss (per-clinic localStorage)
- **Co-exists with OnboardingWidget** — bottom-right wizard pill unaffected

### Enterprise RBAC Enforcement
- **Four-tier role hierarchy** — `superadmin > owner > admin > clinician`, enforced end-to-end
- **Clinician-scoped Settings** — clinicians see only password, MFA, and tour reset; clinic details, KPIs, integrations, team management hidden behind `canManageTeam`
- **Billing page redirect** — clinicians redirected to `/dashboard` on page load
- **Sidebar filtering** — Billing and API Docs nav items hidden for clinician role
- **Billing CTAs removed** — `LockedModulePage`, `ModuleGuard`, `CommandPalette`, `TrialBanner` all show "Ask your clinic owner" instead of billing links for clinicians
- **Onboarding wizard** — clinicians redirected to `/dashboard` (owner/admin-only flow)
- **Checkout flow** — clinicians redirected to `/dashboard`
- **API Docs** — clinicians redirected to `/dashboard`
- **`/api/comms/send`** — added `requireRole(["owner","admin","superadmin"])` (was missing explicit role check)

### Auth Security Fixes
- **AuthGuard pathname bypass** — `pathname.startsWith("/login")` replaced with exact match + separator check to prevent `/loginx` bypass
- **Invited user signup guard** — signup route now checks for existing Firebase Auth users with `status: "invited"` and returns specific `INVITED_USER` error code guiding them to sign in
- **Login page UX** — `INVITED_USER` error auto-switches to sign-in tab with explanation

### Clinic-Wide Data Propagation (Verified)
- **No code changes needed** — `featureFlags`, `targets`, `billing`, `status` all live on the clinic doc (`clinics/{clinicId}`)
- **Real-time sync** — `onSnapshot` listener in `useAuth` propagates module unlocks, target changes, and status updates to all logged-in users under the same clinicId instantly
- **Multi-tenant isolation** — Firestore security rules + `requireClinic()` in API routes enforce clinicId partitioning at every layer

## v0.3.0 — Intelligence, Pulse & Ava (25 Feb 2026)

Three domains: **Intelligence** (analytics), **Pulse** (continuity & comms), **Ava** (voice AI receptionist).

### Intelligence (New)
Revenue analytics, DNA pattern analysis, referral attribution, clinical outcome tracking, and reputation monitoring — delivered as a tabbed analytics workspace replacing the previous module catalogue.

- **Revenue tab** — per-clinician revenue bar chart, revenue by condition with horizontal progress bars, insurance mix percentages
- **DNA Analysis tab** — no-show rate by day of week and by time slot, colour-coded risk thresholds, actionable insight cards
- **Referral Attribution tab** — sortable table: source, type, referred count, conversion rate, total revenue, average course length
- **Outcomes tab** — NPRS and PSFS 90-day trend lines, per-measure improvement cards with directional indicators
- **Reputation tab** — NPS score with promoter/passive/detractor segmentation and monthly trend, Google Review count with velocity chart

### Pulse — Continuity & Comms (New)
Patient communication orchestration layer with sequence management and send logging.

- **Comms Sequences view** — all 6 trigger-based sequences (HEP reminder, rebooking prompt, pre-auth collection, discharge review, 90-day and 180-day reactivation) with per-sequence stats: sent, opened, clicked, rebooked
- **Toggle controls** — enable/disable each sequence independently with channel and delay configuration displayed inline
- **Send Log view** — chronological table of all comms sent: patient name, sequence type, channel badge, send time, open status, outcome (rebooked / no action)
- **Summary stats** — total sent, open rate, click rate, rebook conversion rate as stat cards

### Patient Profiles (New)
Individual patient detail pages accessible from any patient list.

- **Route**: `/patients/[id]` — deep-linkable patient profiles
- **Patient header** — avatar, name, treating clinician, insurance/churn/discharge status badges
- **Key stats** — course progress, days since last session, next session, pre-auth status, HEP programme status
- **Visual course progress** — percentage bar with numbered session indicator dots
- **Activity timeline** — chronological feed of sessions, HEP updates, outcome measure recordings, and comms sent

### Ava — Receptionist (Upgraded)
Transformed from a static empty state into a live call intelligence dashboard with configuration panel. *Ava has been asked to stop ending internal standups with "Is there anything else I can help with?" — she has declined.*

- **Call Dashboard** — today's call count, booking rate, missed calls, average duration
- **7-day volume chart** — bar chart of AI-handled calls per day
- **Live call log** — table: time, patient, phone (masked), duration, clinician, outcome (booked/cancelled/info/missed/transferred)
- **Configuration panel** — voice provider status (ElevenLabs), clinic phone number, operating hours, call handling rules with enabled indicators

### Physitrack / HEP Integration Layer (New)
Abstracted HEP adapter following the same plugin pattern as PMS integrations.

- `HEPAdapter` interface: `testConnection`, `getProgrammes`, `getProgramme`
- Physitrack adapter with REST client, programme mapping, completion percentage tracking
- Factory pattern supporting Physitrack, Rehab My Patient, Wibbi
- `HEPProgramme` type: exercise count, completion %, last access date, deep link support

### Clinician Performance (Enhanced)
- Course completion rate added as a third trend line
- Quick-link buttons to patient view and intelligence deep-dive for selected clinician

### Patient Navigation (Enhanced)
- Patient cards across Pulse and Clinician pages now link to individual patient profiles
